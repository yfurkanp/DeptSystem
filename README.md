# deptSystem

I create simple dept system for a store.I use Spring boot;I use spring data JDBC framework for some database CRUD process.At the same time I also got help JPA;It is the 
ORM specification required to store data permanently and to provide CRUD operations.
Another library that I use and that works very well for me;Thymleaf  is a template engine fully compatible with Spring Boot and other Spring Framework projects.I use some 
Html,css,javascript code and I have a simple front-end also I don't need to use any other framework and very usefull front-end for me.
I used postgre as database because I went live with heroku, because postgre is free on heroku.
Another favorite is spring library;Lombok is  helps us to write cleaner code which is very useful and saves us from code redundancy with anatosians.
